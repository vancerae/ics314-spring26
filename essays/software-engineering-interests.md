## Introduction

My relationship with software engineering is a practical one rather than a passionate one. While I am completing a degree in computer science, I do not plan to pursue a long-term career as a software engineer after graduation. Instead, my goal is to continue my education with a Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS). For me, software engineering is not an end goal, but a set of skills that supports how I want to work with information, systems, and technology in the future.

This essay reflects on my interests in software engineering as a discipline, the skills I would still like to develop, and how my experience in this field contributes to my broader academic and professional goals.

## My Interest in Software Engineering

I would not describe myself as deeply interested in software engineering as a career path. What does interest me is the **structure, discipline, and problem-solving mindset** that software engineering encourages. Courses like ICS 314 have emphasized communication, documentation, version control, and maintainability—skills that extend well beyond writing code.

Rather than building products or applications for users, I am more interested in how software systems organize, preserve, and provide access to information. This perspective aligns more closely with library science than with traditional software development roles.

## Skills I Want to Develop

Even though I do not plan to work as a software engineer, there are several skills from software engineering that I consider valuable and worth developing:

- **Clear technical communication**, especially explaining systems and decisions to non-technical audiences
- **Version control and documentation**, which are essential for long-term maintenance of information systems
- **Understanding data structures and system design**, particularly as they relate to information retrieval and organization
- **Evaluating software tools critically**, rather than using them as black boxes

These skills are directly applicable to work in libraries, archives, and information organizations, where technology plays a critical role in cataloging, digital collections, and access systems.

## Experience Gained So Far

My experience in software engineering courses has helped me become more methodical and intentional in my work. I have learned how to break complex problems into manageable parts, test assumptions, and revise my approach when something does not work as expected.

Working with tools like GitHub and following structured development processes has also given me insight into how large, collaborative systems are maintained over time. This experience has reshaped how I think about technology—not as something to build for its own sake, but as infrastructure that supports long-term access and reliability.

## Reflection and Future Direction

While software engineering is not the field I intend to stay in, the skills I have gained are not wasted. On the contrary, they provide a strong technical foundation for pursuing graduate study in library and information science. Libraries today rely heavily on digital systems, databases, and software-driven workflows, and understanding how those systems are built and maintained is an advantage.

This course has helped me clarify what I value professionally: thoughtful organization, sustainability, and access to information. Software engineering has played an important supporting role in that realization, even if it is not where I ultimately see my career.

## Use of AI Tools

I used ChatGPT as a writing assistant to help organize ideas and improve clarity in this essay. The final content was reviewed and edited to reflect my own perspective and academic goals.
