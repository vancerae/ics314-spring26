## Overview

This project is my professional portfolio built using the TechFolio framework. Rather than focusing on application development, this project emphasizes the organization, presentation, and long-term maintenance of professional and academic information. The portfolio serves as a structured, public-facing record of my work, interests, and reflections throughout my computer science coursework.

This project reflects my interest in software engineering as a **supporting discipline**—one that provides tools for organizing information, documenting work, and communicating clearly with a broad audience.

## Motivation

While I do not plan to pursue a long-term career in software engineering, I recognize the importance of technical literacy and structured communication in any information-focused field. As someone planning to pursue graduate study in Library and Information Science, I am especially interested in how digital systems organize, preserve, and provide access to information over time.

The TechFolio project allowed me to apply software engineering practices to a real-world information system that prioritizes clarity, structure, and usability.

## Features and Design

The portfolio includes:

- A structured layout separating projects, essays, and professional information
- Consistent navigation and visual design
- Clearly written reflections intended for a general audience
- Organized metadata using YAML front matter
- Responsive layout suitable for different devices

Special attention was given to **information architecture**, ensuring that content is easy to locate and understand without requiring technical background knowledge.

## Skills and Practices Demonstrated

This project demonstrates several core software engineering and professional skills:

- Information organization and categorization
- Technical writing for a public audience
- Use of version control for iterative development
- Maintaining consistency across multiple documents
- Applying framework conventions and documentation

Rather than emphasizing code complexity, this project highlights the importance of maintainability, clarity, and thoughtful design decisions.

## Reflection

Working on this portfolio reinforced my view of software as infrastructure rather than a product. The most challenging aspects of the project were not technical, but organizational: deciding how to present information clearly, what to include, and how to structure content so that it remains useful over time.

This project helped me better understand how software engineering practices can support fields like libraries, archives, and information systems, even when software development itself is not the primary goal.

## Use of AI Tools

I used ChatGPT as a writing assistant to help organize ideas and improve clarity in the written content for this project. All content was reviewed and edited to reflect my own understanding and perspective.
