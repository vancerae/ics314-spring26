<p>
During my 2007 deployment, both CIWS mounts aboard my ship were non-operational. Each system had a different failure mode, which meant the parts required to repair one mount could not be used to fix the other.</p>

<p>
As the division lead, I evaluated both systems and determined that restoring at least one CIWS to full operational status was the most effective course of action. I developed an action plan to temporarily reallocate serviceable components from the aft mount to the forward mount. Although this approach went against standard practice, I presented the plan to the chain of command and received authorization to proceed.</p>

<p>
After my team and I completed the component transfer, I again coordinated with leadership to power on and test the system. The forward CIWS functioned as designed, restoring a critical defensive capability to the ship.</p>

<p>
For this effort, my team and I were recognized with Commanding Officer challenge coins and awarded Navy Achievement Medals for restoring the CIWS to operational readiness.
