During my deployment in 2007, we had issues with our two CIWS mounts; neither was working properly. They had different issues, so I knew the parts needed to fix one issue were not the same as those needed to fix the other.

Since I was the lead in my division, I developed an action plan to remove parts from one mount to restore the other to working order.  After we received the authorization, which normally you don't rob Peter to pay Paul, I was able to take the parts from the out aft mount to install in the forward mount to get that up and running.

After the parts were installed, I again obtained permission from the chain of command to turn on the system to verify that the weapons system was operational.  It worked perfectly. My team and I were presented with CO challenge coins, and we received Navy Achievement Medals for fixing our broken CIWS.
